# VGAtonic with Intel Galileo #

This code runs on an Intel Galileo, modified as mentioned in this [post][1].

Once you increase the allowed sketch size your Galileo should have no problem running this code.


## Pins needed: ##

- **13** -- `SCK`
- **11** -- `MOSI`
- **10** -- `CS`


### Optional: ###

- **5V**
- **GND**


## Steps: ##

1. Get the python script in this directory, edit the line which refers to picture name
2. Find a way to install the PIL, Python Imaging Library, http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
3. Format your picture as 640x480.  Optional: use Photoshop or similar to limit the color palette.
4. Copy guitars.h / doge3.h with the output of the script.
5. Upload, be wowed!

We'll do Linux next.
